# Healthcare Insurance Machine Learning Analysis

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis of the Healthcare Insurance dataset. The primary objective is to develop predictive models that estimate medical insurance charges based on personal attributes and geographic factors. We delve into the impact of age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits, and region on healthcare expenses.

## Dataset Description

The Healthcare Insurance dataset comprises essential attributes for the analysis:

- **Age**: The age of the insured person.
- **Sex**: Gender (male or female) of the insured.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children**: The number of dependents covered.
- **Smoker**: Whether the insured is a smoker (yes or no).
- **Region**: The geographic area of coverage.
- **Charges**: The medical insurance costs incurred by the insured person.
